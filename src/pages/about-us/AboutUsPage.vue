        Hype Store was founded in November 2024 as part of a project for our Internet Programming class. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Hype Store specializes in the sale of urban figurines and designer toys.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started by creating the website www.hypestore.com which is a correspondence platform, as well as a place of community exchange around these collection figures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We import and sell adult collection products, in a very colorful, tangy universe, with figurines and characters in a very innovative graphic spirit influenced by the many urban cultures, illustration and contemporary art.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are importers, wholesalers, retailers, consultants, gallerists.
